# Code Challenges
Simple code exercises that any developer should be able to accomplish in 10-15 minutes.<br />
These are my solutions to these exercises.

## Anagram
Anagrams are words or phrases made by mixing up the letters of other words or phrases.<br />
Write a method that detects if a string is an anagram of another.<br />

# Caesar cipher
The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique used by Julius Caesar to securely communicate with his generals.<br />
Each letter is replaced by another letter N positions down the english alphabet.<br />
For example, for a rotation of 5, the letter 'c' would be replaced by an 'h'.<br />
In case of a 'z', the alphabet rotates and it is transformed into a 'd'.<br />
Implement a decoder for the Caesar cipher where N = 4.<br />

## Fibonacci
Write a method that returns the nth element of the Fibonacci Sequence.<br />
The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,...<br />
The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.<br />
Assume that indexes start at zero, e.g., fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1, ...<br />

## FizzBuzz
Write a method that returns 'Fizz' for multiples of three and 'Buzz' for the multiples of five.<br />
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return 'FizzBuzz'.<br />
For numbers that are neither, return the input number.<br />
[Solution](./src/FizzBuzz/Program.cs)

## Greatest common denominator
Write a method that finds the greatest common denominator of two integers, which are not all zero.<br />
The gcd is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without a remainder.<br />
For example, the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4.<br />
[Solution](./src/GreatestCommonDenominator/Program.cs)

## Palindrome
A palindrome is a word which reads the same backward or forward. 'abcba' is a palindrome.<br />
Write a method that detects if a string is a palindrome.<br />
[Solution](./src/Palindrome/Program.cs)

## Prime numbers
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.<br />
Write a method that checks if a number is prime number.<br />
